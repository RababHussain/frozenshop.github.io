					<h1>NEW CHILLS FOR SUMMER</h1>
					<span>By Admin on November 28, 2023</span>
					<p>Every young and old loves to make ice cream. Especially children love ice cream very much, whether returning from school or going to a park for playing, every child loves to buy ice cream. It was firstly made by the Persians in 500BC, </p>
					<p>Chocolate ice cream

						At first, in the list, chocolate ice cream attracts every child, men and women across all the ages. Chocolate ice cream is one of my favorite flavors since childhood. There are different varieties of chocolate varying in their chocolatey-ness like ‘Belgian chocolate’ and rich chocolate ice cream’ and many more. The children and teenagers mostly like the chocolate ice cream.
						
						Vanilla ice cream
						
						The vanilla flavor is the most popular ingredient after the chocolate in the world. Due to the popularity of vanilla, its ice creams are highly popular. The vanilla ice cream contains crushing topping such as chocolate sauce, nuts, etc. It is ideal ice cream with a crushing topping and loved by all ages irrespective of gender. Most of people like a vanilla ice cream from Madagascar because it is a top-quality of ice cream
						
						Cookies and cream
						I think that this flavor came into existence after the Oreo cookies are introduced in the market. It is a combination of ice cream and Oreo biscuits. After that, many ice cream stores saw this trend and added this product to their menus. Today lots of ice cream make us have a mouth-watering experience. The cookie and cream is DIY ice cream.
						
						Mango ice cream

						To all innovative new fanged flavors, some old fruits flavored ice creams have been to find on this list. Mango flavored ice cream has always been enjoyed by me ( whenever there is no chocolate ice cream in the store) and I nibbled on it, I like this ice cream and it is very absolutely delicious.

						The mango is a seasonal fruit and the combination of ice cream and mango which drives  me crazy this a perfect ice cream to eat in hot weather conditions
						
						Strawberry ice cream

						The strawberry ice cream is a popular ice cream that is loved by girls and women. The strawberry is a popular fruit. It has developed mow from its original ice cream to chunkier version with fresh strawberries inserted in it. It is absolutely a winner and has very big fans for it.
